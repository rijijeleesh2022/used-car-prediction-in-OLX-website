# used-car-prediction-in-OLX-website

We are predicting the selling price of the car based on various features of the cars
We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by customers to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. Further, the model will be a good way for management as well as customers to understand the pricing dynamics of a new used car market.


Experimental results & Analysis

The data was divided into two parts training and testing purpose i.e. 70% of data was used for training purpose and 30% of data was used for testing purpose of the machine learning. 
The accuracies of the four machine learning models were checked and compared with one another. 
The Final result was predicted consistent with the algorithm which achieves higher accuracy. 
The main drawback of this project was less number of records that have been utilized.
